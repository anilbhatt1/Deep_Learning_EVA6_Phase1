# Computer Vision : EVA6_Phase1

- This repository will hold the source code for learning belonging to Extensive Vision AI - 6th edition - Phase 1.
- Source code will be updated in relevant folders which will have separate README files with elaborate descriptions.
- Brief details of each sub-repository is as listed below:
- **S3_MNIST_Sum_of_Digits**
    - A CNN neural network that can:
        - Take 2 inputs:
            - an image from MNIST dataset, and
            - a random number between 0 and 9
        - and gives two outputs:
            - the "number" that was represented by the MNIST image, and
            - the "sum" of this number with the random number that was generated and sent as the input to the network         
- **S4_Backpropagation**
    - Created an excel sheet that demonstrated how backpropagation works for different learning rates
- **S5_Drill_Down_Approach**
    - CNN network that achieved 99.41% in 15 epochs with 9680 model parameters for MNIST dataset
- **S6_Batch_Normalization**
    - CNN netowrk that can use Batch Normalization, Layer Normalization, Group Normalization, L1 & L2 Regularization via parametrization
- **S7_Dilated_Depthwise**
    - Image Classification on CIFAR-10 using a CNN network that uses Dilated Convolution, Depthwise Convolution and normal convolutions.
    - Counters were used to collect train & test statistics
- **S8_Gradcam_Resnet18**
    - Image Classification on CIFAR-10 using ResNet-18 and applying Gradcam on 20 misclassified images
- **S9_CustomResNet_OnecycleLR**
    - Image Classification on CIFAR-10 using customized ResNet-18.
    - OneCycle LR was used. Max_LR was found out via range test
